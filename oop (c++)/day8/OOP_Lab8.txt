Day8:
======

1- in "GeoShape" example, do changes required to:
	- prevent anyone from creating object of shape class "make it abstract, using pure virtual function"
	- make another function called "sumOfAllShapesArea", that takes Array of 4 shapes and return sum of these shapes areas.



2- Continue the Picture Example:
      - Write new class Shape with variable color + setters and getters.. Rect, Circle, and Line to Inherit from it.
      - in class Shape Make function "Draw( )", a pure virtual function, then make necessary changes to other classes.
      - Simplify the Picture class, so as to only be constructed by an array of Shapes (array of pointers to Shape), 
	then use the pointer of base class to call the Draw( ) function of Circle, Rect, and Line.



3- Try to navigate through "String" built-in class and try some of its functions


Bouns:
======
- Draw "jagged Array" of shapes...
