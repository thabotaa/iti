Day7:
======
1-
- Composition Example: Point, Rect, Circle, Line + drawing graphics.
	- each class should have: attributes, constructors, setters, Draw()
 
- Aggregation Example: Picture, Point, Rect, Circle, Line + graphics.
	- class Picture should have: attributes, constructors, setters, Paint()
	- set color in (Rect, Circle, Line) before drawing.



2- Late binding --> "Base-Drived-Derived_2" example (Multi-Level inheritance), try the following:
	- create pointer from base points to object from drived "call drived function using base pointer"
	- use "virtual" keyword, then try again to see what is the difference



3- in "Shape" example, do changes required to:
	- prevent anyone from creating object of shape class "make it abstract, 
	- try using "pure virtual function: CalcArea()"


Note: 
- check graphics settings on CodeBlocks.
- Students should Trace the code by F7 or F8 to see the sequence of calling of constructors.
